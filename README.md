# Data Scientist

### Education

PhD in Physics, Brown University - 2022
BA in Mathematics and Economics, Johns Hopkins University - 2015

### Work Experience

Postdoctoral Research Associate, Brown University
- Designed and developed code and analytic tests for a precision simulation package for radio interferometers in Python
- Validated reliability of different interferometric simulation packages, guiding international research groups

Data Science Fellowship
- Analyzed market sentiment from Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Modeled the relationship between historical stock price data and market sentiment using Logistic Regression and
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Improved this model by introducing a lag, increasing the accuracy by 10%

Graduate Research Assistant, Brown University
- Discovered a novel approach to analyze areas of the sky for possible 21cm signal detection
- Analyzed telescope data to fit and validated a potential model using regression and its expected error distribution using
Monte Carlo simulations
- Presented my research at the Science At Low Frequencies conference and teleconferences with international collaborators
- Supervised an undergraduate summer research project, which resulted in a presentation at a national conference
- Collaborated with team members using version control systems such as Git to organize modifications and assign tasks

Graduate Research Assistant, Harvard University
- Developed code in Python calculating the galaxy two-point correlation function using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)
- Conducted tests in Mathematica on a novel method using FFTs to compute galaxy two-point correlation functions
- Improved the performance and accuracy of the FFT method above

### Projects

Natural Language Processing
- Calculated market sentiment from Twitter data
- Modeled the relationship between historical stock price data and market sentiment using Logistic Regression and
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A/B Testing
- Performed A/B testing and analyzed the results to select features to optimize user retention of a mobile game

Reinforcement Learning
- Designed a 2D game with randomly generated maps to train and test our models on procedurally generated levels
- Implemented Q-Learning and PPO models to compare their effectiveness in finding the optimal way of collecting coins
while avoiding an enemy
